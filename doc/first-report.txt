RMAI1 First Report.
===================

  The first report is due on 9th October at 12:00, and should be sent BY EMAIL as PDF
to both john@mmmi.sdu.dk and xizi@mmmi.sdu.dk.  It may be at most 5 pages long, and
there should be one report from each group (not individual).  Remember to include your
GROUP NUMBER in the report text!

  Apart from providing a low first hurdle for assessment, the goal of the report is to
help you formalise the design of your Sokoban robot and get useful critique and advice
about your approach.  Therefore, you need to consider, and write about:

 1.  What behaviours or functions will you equip the robot with, so it can complete
     the Sokoban course successfully?

 2.  What implications do the choices in (1) have for the physical structure of the
     robot?  What sensors will you deploy, and where?  etc.

 3.  What factors do you think will affect the speed and reliability with which your
     robot can execute the Sokoban solution?  How will you evaluate and optimise them?
     (Or, will you optimise them, in fact?)

 4.  How will you test and document your robot's performance for the final report?

Given the length limit, you don't need to include an introduction or conclusion in the
first report, just your thoughts on the four questions above.  You can prepare the
report in whatever format you think is most suitable, provided the finished product
meets the length and submission format requirements.

  From past experience, a good Sokoban robot can execute a 120-step solution plan in
2-3 minutes.  To achieve this kind of performance, you need to make the robot fast,
stable and very very reliable.  Remember, the goal of the course practical is to
achieve a sufficiently stable and reliable robot platform that, despite having quite
restricted sensing and no global view of the real world, allows a symbolic reasoning
planner to construct long plans that will execute successfully: anyone can build a
line follower, but it takes more thought and care to build a Sokoban solving robot
system.
